# This is my home repo

This is where I will put personal files and play around with the features of GitHub.

### Cheatsheet:

- git clone: clones a repo from the web
- git pull/push grabs changes or publishes changes to the web
- git checkout - Switches branches (create new branch with -b)
- git merge - combines two branches together
- git add/rm - Add/remove files for commit
- git commit - commits changes to local repo
